# PWA-Text-Editor

## Description


For this project, I was tasked with integrating progessive web application functionality into an already exsisting text editor. The project utilized the webpack bundler, concurrently npm package, and IndexedDB principles to add this PWA functionality. The project needed routes for GET and POST options as well having the functionality of working when the server is offline. The project functioned in that webpack was used to bundle my server and client files into a dist folder, which was then deployed to Heroku as a functioning text editor. My motivation to complete this project was to better understand the benefits of using PWA principles such as webpack to create a faster and more user friendly experience on the apps I design. I also wanted to improve my knowledge on the folder structure of these PWAs and how mutiple node apps can exist in one project. Along with this, I also wanted to further my knowledge on how to design routes and render html for PWAs.

## Installation

To install this functionality to the Social Network API, run npm run start in the terminal which will prompt the local host to listen on the specified port, and then navigate to that port to use the text editor. Alternatively, vist the Heroku deployed site below.
